# RLS
---

An implementation of the `ls` command recreated in rust.

### Why do this?

Fun, mostly. I wanted some experience with rust and this is a good example of basic I/O.
Plus, I get to specify default options and color schemes that I wouldn't get to with `ls` otherwise. 

Remix if you like, everything's MIT.
